		<h2>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h2>

	<p> The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a novella written by Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) published in 1886; it tells about a respectable Londoner doctor ,Dr Jekyll, who after trying on himself a new drug he created he gets split in two personalities: Dr. Jekyll, the good one, and Mr. Hyde, which incarnates the evil part of his spirit. Hyde start committing terrible homicides, and in order to stop him, Dr. Jekyll commits suicide.<br>
	This story shares many themes with Star Wars: <br>
<b>Good vs. Evil-</b> Good vs. evil is basically the novel’s biggest theme. More specifically, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is easily viewed as an allegory about the good and evil that exist in all men, and about our struggle with these two sides of the human personality. An such it is in star wars: the entity of the Force is divided two aspects: the light and dark side; In this book, then, the battle between good and evil rages within the individual.And so it happens in star wars, more precisely in the prequel trilogy, in the character of Anakin; Anakin is torn apart by he's two personalities: the personality of anakin who is good, the perfect example of a Jedi Knight which would never harm without reason and would never kill someone; and Darth Vader, his evil counterpart, the perfect example of a Sith Lord, which gains strenght from anger and hate. The question is which is superior. Since Hyde seems to be taking over, one could argue that evil is stronger than good. However, Hyde does end up dead at the end of the story, perhaps suggesting a weakness or failure of evil. In star wars the evil side seems to be, as in this novella, the stronger part: even the strongest Jedi could do nothing against the fury of Darth Vader during the Great Jedi Purge; but in the end Darth Vader is defeated because he loses everything he cared about.  The big question, of course, is whether or not good can be separated from evil, or whether the two are forever intertwined.<br>
<b>Theme of appearances-</b> In the novella are dr.jekyll and Mr. Hyde are described differentyly: one is always well dressed and clean, the other is dirty, bad dressed and appears smaller than Dr. Jekyll. In star wars Jedi wear light brown robes, while Sith Lords wear dark robes. Jedi use light coloured lightsabers like green and blue, while Sith use dark red lightsavers. The character of Anakin is a jedi so it wears light robes, but when he starts evolving into Vader, he starts wearing darker clothes and eventually wears a pitch black armor and a scary black mask.<br>
<b>Theme of repression-</b>The repression here is that of Victorian England: no sexual appetites, no violence, and no great expressions of emotion, at least in the public sphere. Everything is sober and dignified, and you’re really not supposed to be happy. This could be the summary of the Jedi code: as a jedi you cannot feel emotions, you have to be in a continous state of calm and equilibrium; a jedi cannot have children nor a wife, they can only serve the order of the jedi. All these restriction caused in Anakin the exact oppisite: he is always worried for padme and he can't think straight, blinded by rage and fear.</p>

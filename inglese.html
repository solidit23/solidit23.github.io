		<h2>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h2>

	<p> ‘The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ is a novella written by Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) published in 1886; it is about a respectable London doctor, Dr. Jekyll, who develops two personalities after trying his new drug on himself: Dr. Jekyll, the good one, and Mr. Hyde, who incarnates the evil part of his spirit. Hyde starts committing terrible homicides, and to stop him, Dr. Jekyll commits suicide.<br>
	This story shares many themes with Star Wars: <br>
<b>Good vs. Evil-</b> Good vs. evil is basically the story’s biggest theme. More specifically, ‘Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ is easily viewed as an allegory about the good and evil that exist in all men, and about our struggle with these two sides of the human personality. Such it is in 'Star Wars': the entity of the Force is divided into two aspects: the light and dark side. In Stevenson’s book, the battle between good and evil rages within the individual. The same happens in 'Star Wars', more precisely in the prequel trilogy, in the character of Anakin. Anakin is torn apart by his two personalities: the good personality is the perfect example of a Jedi Knight who would never harm without reason and would never kill anyone; his evil counterpart is Darth Vader, the perfect example of a Sith Lord, who gains strength from anger and hate. The question is which is superior. In the novella since Hyde seems to be taking over, one could argue that evil is stronger than good. However, Hyde does end up dead at the end of the story, perhaps suggesting a weakness or failure of evil. In ‘Star Wars’ the evil side seems to be, as in Stevenson’s book, the stronger part: even the strongest Jedi could do nothing against the fury of Darth Vader during the Great Jedi Purge; but in the end Darth Vader is defeated because he loses everything he cared about. The big question, of course, is whether good can be separated from evil, or whether the two are forever intertwined.<br>
<b>Theme of appearances-</b> In the novella, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are described differently: one is always well-dressed and clean, the other is dirty, badly dressed and appears smaller than Dr. Jekyll. In 'Star Wars' Jedi wear light brown robes, while Sith Lords wear dark robes. Jedi use light coloured lightsabers such as green and blue, while Sith use dark red lightsabers. The character of Anakin is a Jedi so he wears light robes, but when he starts evolving into Vader, he starts wearing darker clothes and eventually wears pitch black armour and a scary black mask.<br>
<b>Theme of repression-</b>Theme of repression -The repression in ‘Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is that of Victorian England: no sexual appetite, no violence, and no great expressions of emotion, at least in the public sphere. Everything is sober and dignified, and you’re really not supposed to be happy. This could be the summary of the Jedi code: as a Jedi you cannot feel emotions, you must be in a constant state of calm and equilibrium;a Jedi cannot have children nor a wife, they can only serve the order of the Jedi. All these restrictions caused in Anakin the exact opposite: he is always worried for Padme and he can't think straight, blinded by rage and fear.</p>
